# 🐋 The Big Walrus NFT Project

Welcome to **The Big Walrus**—a unique NFT project where art and technology meet to create a captivating digital experience. This project aims to bring **The Big Walrus** to life on the web through a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## Project Overview

The Big Walrus is an ongoing project where we designed a web page from scratch to showcase our NFTs, providing users with an immersive journey into the world of The Big Walrus. The website was initially designed in **Figma** for visualization and prototyping. Once the design was approved, we brought it to life using **React**, leveraging its powerful UI capabilities to create a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
- **NFT Showcase**: A clean, dynamic gallery to highlight each NFT in the collection.
- **Smooth Animations**: Bringing elements to life for an engaging user experience.
- **React-based Architecture**: Modern, component-driven design for maintainability and scalability.

## Tech Stack
- **Figma** - Initial prototyping and UI/UX design.
- **React** - Front-end framework for building the web app.
- **CSS Modules** - For styling components individually.

Below are some screenshots of the current state of The Big Walrus website. This is a **work in progress**, and we are continually refining it to enhance user experience.
