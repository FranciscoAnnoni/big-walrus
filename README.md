Welcome to **The Big Walrus**—a unique NFT project where art and technology meet to create a captivating digital experience. This project aims to bring **The Big Walrus** to life on the web through a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## Project Overview

The Big Walrus is an ongoing project where we designed a web page from scratch to showcase our NFTs, providing users with an immersive journey into the world of The Big Walrus. The website was initially designed in **Figma** for visualization and prototyping. Once the design was approved, we brought it to life using **React**, leveraging its powerful UI capabilities to create a seamless and interactive user experience.

### How the Idea Came About
The idea for "The Big Walrus" emerged from our shared passion for wildlife conservation, digital art, and the growing trend of NFTs. After brainstorming, we decided to create an NFT collection that not only showcases art but also spreads awareness for marine life conservation, focusing on the majestic walrus.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
- **NFT Showcase**: A clean, dynamic gallery to highlight each NFT in the collection.
- **Smooth Animations**: Bringing elements to life for an engaging user experience.
- **React-based Architecture**: Modern, component-driven design for maintainability and scalability.

## Tech Stack
- **Figma** - Initial prototyping and UI/UX design.
- **React** - Front-end framework for building the web app.
- **CSS Modules** - For styling components individually.
